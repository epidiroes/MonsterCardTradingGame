# MonsterCardTradingGame aka Monster Trading Card Game

While naming the project I got a little confused and named it MonsterCardTradingGame instead of MonsterTradingCardGame.
I didn't want to rename it again, so I left it that way and also named the package folder 'mctg' accordingly.

## About the project

This project was created within the context of the class Software Engineering 1 as a semester project.
It is a server application that handles requests to specific routes and sends responses back.
More information regarding the design and tests can be found in Protocol.md.
